# Memory Game
Single page memory game web app made during my participation in the Udacity Google Challenge Scholarship

# About
This game was designed to be responsive across devices. The game board utilizes a grid layout while the rest of the UI uses flex. Landscape functionality was added for mobile devices.

The timer will start as soon as the first card is clicked. Turns are counted after a pair of cards have been selected. The three star rating is determined by the amount of mismatches made during the game. The reset button works by clearing the grid of cards and rebuilding it.
after the animation of the final match is finished a modal will be revealed with the stats of the match and a reset button.
